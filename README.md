Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

(run `npm start` in the `/backend` directory to start a GraphQL backend for this app)

See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
